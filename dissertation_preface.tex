First and foremost I wish to express my gratitude to my supervisor Prof. Juho Rousu for his invaluable advises and guidance.
None of the these can happen without his support and help.

The thesis summarizes the work I have carried out mainly at the Helsinki Institute for Information Technology HIIT, the Department of Information and Computer Science (ICS), Aalto University between early 2012 and late 2014.
Part of the work has been done at the Department of Computer Science, University of Helsinki during the year 2011 when I started as a doctoral student.
The work has been generously funded by the Helsinki Doctoral Programme in Computer Science (Hecse), the Academy of Finland (Finnish Centre of Excellence in Algorithm and Data Analysis 118653), including the support for attending international conferences and research visits.

I am lucky to be a part of the research group \textit{Kernel Machine, Pattern Analysis and Computational Biology} led Prof. Rousu.
I will to thanks all group members I had worked with for the discussion and the inspiration: Esa Pitk\"anen, Markus Heinonen, Huibin Shen, Jana Kludas, 
Nicole Althermeler, Jefrey Lijffijt, Celine Brouard, Elena Czeizler, Anna Cichonska, Viivi Uurtio. 




I am thankful to the pre-examiners -- and -- for their effort to provide invaluable comments to further improve the thesis.
