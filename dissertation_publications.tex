\citepub{su14a} presents a novel formulation of the network response prediction problem, and proposes an structured output learning algorithm to solve the problem.
The algorithm captures the context information and has a superior performance over several the state-of-art models.

The initial modeling idea was developed jointly by the authors.
The problem was jointly formulated.
The algorithm was mainly developed by the author and Prof. Rousu.
Prof. Gionis made major contribution to the idea of SDP inference.
The author implemented the algorithm, designed and conducted the experiment, and analyzed the results.
All author participated in designing and writing the article.

\addcontribution{
\citepub{su11} proposes an ensemble approach for structured output prediction problem with application in  drug-bioactivity prediction.
The model tackles the situation where there is no-prior information about the output structure, thus naturally extends \citepub{su10}.

The idea of the ensemble scheme was jointly developed. 
In addition, the author contributed mainly to the algorithm design and implementation and the experiments.
The article are joint written by the authors.
