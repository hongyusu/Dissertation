\addcontribution{
\citepub{su14a} presents a novel formulation of the network response prediction problem, and proposes an structured output learning algorithm to solve the problem.
The algorithm captures the context information and has a superior performance over several the state-of-art models.

The initial modeling idea was developed jointly by the authors.
The problem was jointly formulated.
The algorithm was mainly developed by the author and Prof. Rousu.
Prof. Gionis made major contribution to the idea of SDP inference.
The author implemented the algorithm, designed and conducted the experiment, and analyzed the results.
All author participated in designing and writing the article.

\addcontribution{
The novelty of \citepub{su10} is to develop a structured output prediction model and apply it on drug-bioactivity prediction problem.
The advanced model can captures the relationship between cancer cell-line targets, thus, enjoys better performance compared to previous single-task prediction model.

The original modeling idea was jointly developed.
%The implementation of the algorithm was mainly contributed by Prof. Rousu.
The author contribute to the designing of the experiments and executing the algorithm.
All author participated in writing the articles.

Springer LNBI volume 7035:157-167}{November}{2011}{Copyright 2014 by the authors}{su11}
\addcontribution{
\citepub{su11} proposes an ensemble approach for structured output prediction problem with application in  drug-bioactivity prediction.
The model tackles the situation where there is no-prior information about the output structure, thus naturally extends \citepub{su10}.

The idea of the ensemble scheme was jointly developed. 
In addition, the author contributed mainly to the algorithm design and implementation and the experiments.
The article are joint written by the authors.
