\addcontribution{

\citepub{su14a} presents a novel formalism of the network response prediction problem, and proposes a structured output learning algorithm to solve the problem.
The proposed algorithm, \spin, captures the contextual information and improves the state-of-the-art models in terms of the prediction performance.

The definition of the problem and the original modeling idea were developed jointly.
The author made major contribution to the design of the learning system and the optimization algorithm.
The author implemented the learning system and the inference algorithm.
The author designed and performed the experiment and analyzed the result.
